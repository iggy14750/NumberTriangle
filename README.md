#Minimum-Sum Numeric Triangle

###**Problem:**

This prompt was lifted from [Project Euler #150](https://projecteuler.net/problem=150).  But for a brief summary, it works like this: arrange a bunch of positive numbers into a pyramid or triangle, and pick the triangle within the whole with the sum of its members being less than any of the others'.  Again, for a detailed description of the problem, see the page above.

###Details

This project belongs to Isaac B Goss and Kyle Legters for our COE 0147 Computer Organization and Assembly Language midterm project.  

"Psuedo"-code in this document will probably be recorded in Python, although the project is implemented in Java and then MIPS assembly.  A useful Python module is also provided to calculate some useful things regarding this project.
